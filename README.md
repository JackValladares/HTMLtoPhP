# HTMLtoPhP
>A simple little program that inputs raw HTML code (in the html.txt file) and outputs a php echo statement with the formatted HTML Code. Decided to make this when I wanted to turn a huge chunk of HTML into re-usable PhP echo statements, but the process of doing so was tedious and repetitive.

-To use this program, compile the source code into a jar file, and put the jar file in the same directory as a file called "html.txt" with the html you'd like to convert. Run the jar file and another file called "PhP.txt" will be created in the same directory, with the same HTML Code formatted into an echo statement that can be plopped directly into any PhP file.

-To-Do:
Give the program a GUI
Clean up echo statement a little bit so that left quotation mark is indented propertly
Add extra functionality when new PhP and HTML related conundrums arise
